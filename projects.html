             <p class="card__description">
                The Aerospace Simulation Software is a Java-based application that simulates the dynamics of aerospace vehicles. 
                It provides a graphical user interface (GUI) using JavaFX to visualize the movement and parameters of the vehicles in real-time.
                <br>
                Add multiple aerospace vehicles with custom parameters.
                Simulate the dynamics of the vehicles including velocity and altitude changes.
                Real-time graphical visualization of the vehicle's movements.
                Controls to start, stop, reset, speed up, and slow down the simulation.

             <p class="card__description">
                Drastic is a AI that helps with calculating the needs for Goods, transport, and personnel needed for rescue/disaster situations. 
                It is designed to calculate if the disaster relief will be a success or failure. 
                <br> <br>
                Drastic handles calculations for 3 main catagories. <br>
                Goods : Food / Goods / Items / Medicine <br>
                Personnel : Volunteers / Doctors / Engineers / etc <br>
                Transportation : Type / Cost / Carry-Capacity / # of type of vehicle <br> <br>

                Drastic allows for a user to input various data for calculations. <br>
                Name of disaster <br>
                # of people effected (This may include injured, loss of power, loss of home, etc) <br>
                location of disaster (using google API for narowing down specific towns/cities) <br>
                # of days known and or expected for disaster to effect population <br> <br>
                </p>

             <p class="card__title">MIME - Voice Assistant</p>
             <p class="card__description">
                Mime voice assistant is a replication of Siri/Alexa. <br> <br>
                Mime allows for a user to give audio input and recieve audio output. <br>
                The user can ask various questions regarding weather, interent search results, etc. <br> <br>
                This program was designed using Python and various Python libraries that help create a chat model. <br> <br>
                With simple changes to its training model and base requests, this program can be adapted to various industries as a helpful chat tool, as well as be used in a team setting to help with workflow. <br>
                I aim to improve its voice model to be more friendly. Additionally, I would want to create a higher sense of relationship between the program and its user to provide more meaninful and personal answers.

             <p class="card__description">
                This program allows a user to store color codes and create color code templates that they can save for later use.
                <br>
                It runs with a C++ Backend and a Html, CSS, Javascript Frontend. This program tested by abilities by introducing new libraries. 
                It also allowed for learning more about blending multiple languages to create a program. 
                XAML files are new to me so that was a new stepping stone in the progression of this program.
                <br>
                This Color Code Manager program can be adapted for use by multiple industries such as Graphic Design, Artists, Makeup Artists, Interior Designers, etc. 
                I would want to continue to improve the UI/UX of the program to be easier and cleaner for the user. 
                This personal project was a learning curve with the blend of languages and was a fun challenge!
